📄 MessUp Project Documentation

📌 Overview

    MessUp is a full-stack real-time chat application built with Spring Boot for the backend and React.js for the frontend. 
    It allows users to communicate via group chats and (in future updates) personal one-to-one chats, with plans for optional voice and video communication. 
    The project is designed to be scalable, secure, and developer-friendly.

🎯 Goals

    Enable group and personal chats using WebSockets.
    Build a responsive, modern frontend UI.
    Maintain secure, scalable backend architecture.
    Avoid privacy violations even though the app is self-hosted.
    Document the entire system professionally.
